However when I moved it back 1.5 cm (4.4cm from true center) my entire impression changed: I was able to drive the skis harder and enjoy confidence in my skiing. Extremely impressive edge grip on steeps and trees.  Low swing weight makes it great for hop turns but also the the rearward mounting position allows me to drive my turns hard all the while keeping the shovels above the snow.    It was great in soft smaller moguls, however, in larger moguls it's light weight showed itself.  It definitely has a speed limit.
